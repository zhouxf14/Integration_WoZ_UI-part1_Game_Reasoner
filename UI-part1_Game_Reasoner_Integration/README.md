# SCIPR WoZ UI-part1
This is the WoZ UI-part1 for SCIPR project at ArticuLab. UI-part1 is used for WoZer to update game representations in Outbreak game so that the Outbreak game reasoner can use these game representations for virtual player's behavior generation.
## Getting started
### Prerequisites

The UI-part1 is coded with Java so a Java IDE is needed to run the code after the code package of UI-part1 is downloaded. 

```
Download Eclipse.
Create a new Java project.
Change the default location into where you have downloaded the folder of UI-part1 project.
```

### Installing

All the JARs needed in running UI-part1 are all in the UI-part1's project libs, which do not require extra installing.
